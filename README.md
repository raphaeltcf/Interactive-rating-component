# Interactive rating component


This is the third challenge I do with Frontend Mentor, this time using HTML, CSS and JAVASCRIPT.
The challenge was to create a responsive Interactive rating component, I really liked the result.

Just a watch made to train the concepts of HTML, CSS AND JS. 

## 🚀 Starting

These instructions will allow you to get a working copy of the project on your local machine for development and testing purposes.

### 📋 Prerequisites

Before starting, you will need to have the following tools installed on your machine:
[Git](https://git-scm.com), [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/). 
Also it's nice to have an editor to work with the code like [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/)

```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/raphaeltcf/Interactive-rating-component
